# New year - new blog

First of all I want to thank the guys at <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> for the opportunity to use github pages to easily create this blog, and the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">minimal mistakes theme</a> developers that made it easy to get started with! I really didn't want to use wordpress for that, and you made that possible and elegant!
